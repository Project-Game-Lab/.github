<strong>Welcome To Project Game Labs Github Repo!</strong>

This is ground zero for all of our projects, whether they are complete, in progress or upcomming. If you're new here, you won't be able to see much, but that's ok because we are always looking for new people to join our community. 

Some useful links to get yourself orientated into our community:
- [Our Wiki](https://wiki.projectgamelab.org) - **This is the home of Project game lab**
- [Our Discord](https://discord.gg/M4QzGHHnku) - **A place for contributors to work on projects, and for lurkers to see what we're up to**
- [Our itch.io](https://projectgamelab.itch.io/) - **Explore our upcoming and released games**
